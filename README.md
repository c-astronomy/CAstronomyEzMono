### CAstronomyEzMono
A simple script that automates the boring part of editing.

##WHAT YOU NEED:
SHO subs or an RGB image taken with DUAL-NARROWBAND filter.  
RC-blurX / noiseX / starX *You can run the program without them if you don't tick the boxes!  
***By using an RBG image it will automaticly put the script in OSC-DUONARROWBAND mode and create a fake SHO/HUBBLE image if named rgb***  

##INSTRUCTIONS:
#mono.  
Add your SHO subs.  
Name them: s  h  o ***lowercase is important***  

#rgb.
Add your rgb image.  
Name it rgb ***lowercase is important***  
***This mode ignores crop/abe and the palette settings and creates a fake SHO/HUBBLE palette!***  

##KNOWN BUGS IN CURRENT VERSION:
HOO palette with only H and O sub is disabled atm, HOO palette will still work fine if you add s sub tho. ***you can walk around it by copy any of the subs and name it s***  
StarX - stars might have some odd stretch to them.  

##COMMING:  
Tba.
